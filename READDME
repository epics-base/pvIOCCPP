v3Channel
=========

v3Channel is a PVAccess server that runs in the V3 IOC.
This allows you to get, put and monitor V3 records over pvAccess.

To run the example:

make
testApp/st.sh

Then try 'pvget TESTDOUBLE' from another shell. 
The pvget command line tool is part of the pvAccessCPP.

Linking to v3Channel 
====================

To use the v3Channel library with your v3 IOC:

1) add the v3Channel dbd to your IOC, for example in testV3ChannelInclude.dbd:

include "base.dbd"
include "v3Channel.dbd"

2) add the EPICSv4 libraries, for example in testApp/testV3Channel/src/Makefile:

testV3Channel_LIBS += pvIOC pvData pvAccess
testV3Channel_LIBS += $(EPICS_BASE_IOC_LIBS)

3) start v3Channel in your st.cmd, for example in iocBoot/testV3Channel/st.cmd:

iocInit()

epicsThreadSleep(2.0)
startV3Channel
