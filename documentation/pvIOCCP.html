<p>pvIOC is one of a set of related projects:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>pvData</dt>
    <dd>Describes and implements structured data.</dd>
  <dt>pvAccess</dt>
    <dd>Provides networking for pvData.</dd>
  <dt>pvIOC</dt>
    <dd>Provides a database based on pvData together with record processing,
      record scanning, and extensible support.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For pvData and pvAccess both Java and C++ implementations are available. For
pvIOC the Java implementation is named javaIOC and is available.</p>

<p>At the present time the only part of pvIOCCP that is implemented is pvAccess
to V3 records. It is all that is described in this document. A complete Java
implemantation is available but it can not be used inside a V3 IOC.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="L66">V3Channel</h2>
<hr />

<h3 id="L70">Introduction</h3>

<p>V3Channel is an implementation of pvAccess Channel that provides access to
V3 records. It can be used accesss V3 records by other code in the same IOC or
by pvAccess network clients via remote pvAccess. It implements channelProcess,
channelGet, channelPut, channelArray, and Monitor. It does not implement
channelPutGet or channelRPC since, at least for now, these do not apply to V3
records.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to map what V3 records provide into a PVStruructure that
has the same information. For example if a client asks for a ChannelGet for
everything for an analog type channel what the client gets is something
like:</p>
<pre>record double01
    double value 2.0
    structure alarm
        severity major
        message LOLO
    timeStamp 2011-04-13 06:56:06.932
    structure display
        string description 
        string format %f
        string units Counts
        structure limit
            double low 0.0
            double high 10.0
    structure control
        structure limit
            double low -0.1
            double high 9.9
        double minStep 0.0</pre>

<p>The channelName can be either just a record name or a "recordName.XXX" where
XXX is the V3 field name, e. g. "SCAN".</p>

<h3 id="L80">Remaining tasks</h3>
The main remaining tasks are: 
<dl>
  <dt>Access Security</dt>
    <dd>Since V3Channnel is not using any of the remote part of V3CA, it
      "sidesteps" access security. The V3 access security system is independent
      of CAV3 so it is possible to make V3Channel attach to it directly.</dd>
  <dt>Monitor Algorithm</dt>
    <dd>The javaIOC supports an extensible set of monitor algorithms. It
      provides support for onChange and onPercentChange but allows additional
      algorithms. This same support will be implemented by pvIOCCP.</dd>
  <dt>Alarm Limits</dt>
    <dd>Currently it is not possible to get alarmLimits via V3Channel.</dd>
  <dt>V3Channel::init</dt>
    <dd>This creates the introspection interface that is returned by getField.
      Currently it always has property fields alarm, timeStamp, and display. If
      the field is not an array it also has a property field control. It might
      be better to look at the record support entry table to see if display and
      control should be included.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="L105">Getting started</h3>

<p>NOTE: pvIOCCP has a zip file example/example.zip that provides an example
IOC application that provides V3Channel support. To use it copy and unzip and
read the README file.</p>

<p>pvIOCCPP runs in a regular V3 IOC as defined by EPICS base. It uses the base
build system and is built as an EPICS application. To use V3Channel do the
following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Create an epics application</dt>
    <dd>Look at the example to see how to get started.</dd>
  <dt>configure/RELEASE</dt>
    <dd>Add the location of pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP, and PVIOCCP. For example: 
      <pre>VBASE=/home/mrk/hg
PVDATA=${PVBASE}/pvDataCPP
PVACCESS=${PVBASE}/pvAccessCPP
PVIOC=${PVBASE}/pvIOCCPP
   </pre>
    </dd>
  <dt>pvIOC.dbd</dt>
    <dd>In the src directory where your application is being built add an
      include statement for pvIOC.dbd. For example: 
      <pre>include "base.dbd"
include "pvIOC.dbd"
     </pre>
    </dd>
  <dt>st.cmd</dt>
    <dd>After the iocInit command in the st.cmd file add: 
      <pre>startPVAccessServer
    </pre>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="L138">Implementation</h3>

<p>The implementation consists of the following header files:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>v3Channel.h</dt>
    <dd>The V3Channel interface. It implements both ChannelProvider and
      Channel. For example this is what remote pvAccess sees.</dd>
  <dt>v3Util.h</dt>
    <dd>The interace for transfering data between V3 records and pvData, i. e.
      the code that converts between the V3 data and pvData.</dd>
  <dt>v3Array.h</dt>
    <dd>Because arrays are more complex than scalar data they are handled by a
      separate interface instead of by v3util itself.</dd>
  <dt>v3CAMonitor.h</dt>
    <dd>db_post_event is implement in code (dbEvent) that passes events
      directly to CAV3. This the only way V3Channel can trap monitors is via
      CAV3. But V3Channel only uses CAV3 for scalar data, timeStamp, and
      alarms. All other monitored data is obtained from the V3 record
    itself.</dd>
  <dt>CAV3Context.h</dt>
    <dd>This is code that interfaces between pvAccess threads and CAV3
    context.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Associated with each header file is a corrseponding implementation file
which has the same file name as the header but with an extension of ".cpp". The
remainder of this section gives a brief description of each of these software
components with an emphasis on how data is converted between pvData and data in
V3 records.</p>

<h4 id="L170">Main Concepts</h4>

<p>In epics V3 there are two interfaces for accessing data:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>db_access</dt>
    <dd>This defines all the DBR_XXX types and associated C structures as seen
      by CAV3 clients. V3Channel, with the exception of V3CAMonitor does not
      use this. Even for monitors only a few of the DBR_XXX types are used.</dd>
  <dt>dbAccess</dt>
    <dd>This and some additional interfaces like the RSET (record support entry
      table) and the DBADDR are what V3Channel uses to get/put data from the V3
      records. Wherever possible data is accessed via the DBADDR and RSET.
      pvAccess method pvPutField is used to put data to fields that have "side
      effects". For example writing to the SCAN field has side effects.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="L185">V3Channel</h4>

<p>This defines two interfaces:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>V3ChannelProvider</dt>
    <dd>The implementation of ChannelProvider.</dd>
  <dt>V3Channel</dt>
    <dd>The implementation of Channel.</dd>
</dl>

<p>V3ChannelProvider is defined as:</p>
<pre>class V3ChannelProvider : publicChannelProvider {
public:
    static V3ChannelProvider &amp;getChannelProvider();
    virtual String getProviderName();
    virtual void destroy();
    virtual ChannelFind *channelFind(String channelName,ChannelFindRequester *channelFindRequester);
    virtual Channel *createChannel(String channelName,ChannelRequester *channelRequester,short priority);
    virtual Channel *createChannel(String channelName,ChannelRequester *channelRequester,short priority,String address);
private:
 ...
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getChannelProvider</dt>
    <dd>This returns the single instance od the V3ChannelProvider.</dd>
  <dt>getProviderName</dt>
    <dd>This returns "v3Channel"</dd>
  <dt>channelFind</dt>
    <dd>Calls dbNameToAddr to see if the requested channelName is in the V3
      database. If calls channelFindRequester-&gt;channelFindResult to report
      the result. It always returns null.</dd>
  <dt>createChannel</dt>
    <dd>Calls dbNameToAddr to see if the requested channelName is in the V3
      database. If not it calls
      channelRequester-&gt;channelCreated(notFoundStatus,0) and returns null.
      If it is in the V3 database it creates a new V3Channel, calls init, calls
      channelRequester-&gt;channelCreated(Status::OK,v3Channel) and returns the
      newly created V3Channel.</dd>
</dl>

<p>V3Channel is defined as:</p>
<pre>class V3Channel : public virtual Channel {
public:
    V3Channel(
        V3ChannelProvider &amp;provider,ChannelRequester &amp;requester,String name,
        std::auto_ptr&lt;DbAddr&gt; addr);
    void init();
    virtual void destroy();
    virtual String getRequesterName();
    virtual void message(String message,MessageType messageType);
    virtual ChannelProvider *getProvider();
    virtual String getRemoteAddress();
    virtual Channel::ConnectionState getConnectionState();
    virtual String getChannelName();
    virtual ChannelRequester *getChannelRequester();
    virtual bool isConnected();
    virtual void getField(GetFieldRequester *requester,String subField);
    virtual AccessRights getAccessRights(PVField *pvField);
    virtual ChannelProcess *createChannelProcess(ChannelProcessRequester *channelProcessRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual ChannelGet *createChannelGet(ChannelGetRequester *channelGetRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual ChannelPut *createChannelPut(ChannelPutRequester *channelPutRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual ChannelPutGet *createChannelPutGet(ChannelPutGetRequester *channelPutGetRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual ChannelRPC *createChannelRPC(ChannelRPCRequester *channelRPCRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual Monitor *createMonitor(MonitorRequester *monitorRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual ChannelArray *createChannelArray(ChannelArrayRequester *channelArrayRequester,PVStructure *pvRequest);
    virtual void printInfo();
    virtual void printInfo(StringBuilder out);
    // following only called by other V3ChannelXXX code
    void removeChannelProcess(ChannelProcessListNode &amp;);
    void removeChannelGet(ChannelGetListNode &amp;);
    void removeChannelPut(ChannelPutListNode &amp;);
    void removeChannelMonitor(ChannelMonitorListNode &amp;);
    void removeChannelArray(ChannelArrayListNode &amp;);
private:
 ...
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>V3Channel</dt>
    <dd>This is the constructor called by V3ChannelProvider.</dd>
  <dt>init</dt>
    <dd>This is called by V3ChannelProvider after it has created the V3Channel.
      It's primary function is to create a FieldConstPtr that provides the
      introspection interface for the field being accessed. This is what is
      returned by getField. It is always a structure with a value field that
      has a type determined by the V3 field being accessed. It always has
      property fields value, timeStamp, alarm, and display. In addition if the
      value field is not an array a control property field. NOTE: It might be
      better to look at the record support entry table to determine what
      property fields to include.</dd>
  <dt>destroy</dt>
    <dd>This is called by whoever accesses the V3Channel. For example remote
      PVAccess calls this when the client disconnects from the channel.</dd>
  <dt>getRequesterName</dt>
    <dd>Get the requester that created the V3Channel.</dd>
  <dt>message</dt>
    <dd>This is a method that can be called by any code associated with the
      V3Channel. It just passes the message to the requester.</dd>
  <dt>getProvider</dt>
    <dd>This returns the provider which is V3ChannelProvider.</dd>
  <dt>getRemoteAddress</dt>
    <dd>This returns String("local").</dd>
  <dt>getConnectionStatus</dt>
    <dd>This returns Channel::CONNECTED;</dd>
  <dt>getChannelRequester</dt>
    <dd>This gets the requester that asked to create the channel.</dd>
  <dt>isConnected</dt>
    <dd>Always returns true.</dd>
  <dt>getField</dt>
    <dd>This returns the introspection interface created by init.</dd>
  <dt>getAccessRights</dt>
    <dd>This is currentky throws an exception. As stated in the TODO list this
      should interact with the V3 access security system.</dd>
  <dt>createChannelProcess</dt>
    <dd>This creates a V3ChannelProcess and then call V3ChannelProcess::init.
      Process is implemented via a V3 dbPutNotify to the .PROC field of the
      record.</dd>
  <dt>createChannelGet</dt>
    <dd>This creates a V3ChannelGet and then calls V3ChannelGet::init. The
      implementation uses V3Util to do most of the work. See V3Util below for
      details. It is responsible for creating the PVStructure that holds the
      data and for getting data from the V3 record and putting it into the
      PVStructure. If an option to process is given then the record is
      processed via a dbPutNotify to the PROC field before data is fetched.
      Note that display and control data is only returned for the first get,
      i.e. display and control data do not change.</dd>
  <dt>createChannelPut</dt>
    <dd>This creates a V3ChannelPut and then calls V3ChannelPut::init. The
      implementation uses V3Util to do most of the work. See V3Util below for
      details. It is responsible for creating the PVStructure that holds the
      data and for getting/putting data between the V3 record and the
      PVStructure. Although properties alarm, timeStamp, control, and display
      can be requested they can not be modified because V3 does not allow them
      to be changed by a client. If a V3 dbPut to a field has side effects than
      a put results in a call to the V3 dbPut. Examples are a put to the SCAN
      field. It actually changes the scanning mechanism for the record. If a V3
      dbPut does not have side effects other than causing a record to process a
      put does NOT result in a call to the V3 dbPut. Instead processing is
      determined by the pvAccess client. If the client requests processing the
      normal pvAccess semantics are used, i. e. the record is processed via a
      dbPutNotify to the PROC field after the data is written into the V3
      record.</dd>
  <dt>createChannelPutGet</dt>
    <dd>This is not implemented since it does not make sense for V3 records.
    </dd>
  <dt>createChannelRPC</dt>
    <dd>This is not implemented since it does not make sense for V3
    records.</dd>
  <dt>createMonitor</dt>
    <dd>This is implemented via a monitior request call to CAV3. See
      V3CaMonitor below for details.</dd>
  <dt>createChannelArray</dt>
    <dd>This creates a V3ChannelArray that implements the normal ChannelArray
      semantics. It uses DBADDR and the RSET to direcly access the array in the
      V3 record.</dd>
  <dt>printInfo</dt>
    <dd>This just prints a short message.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="L334">V3Util</h4>

<p>This does most of the work related to transfering data between a PVStructure
and a V3 record. All methods are static and are called by V3ChannelGet,
V3ChannelPut, etc. Each first calls getProperty which returns a mask that is
passed to the other methods. The mask bits show a combination of what the
requester requested and characteristics of the V3 field being accessed. The
mask has the following bits:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>processBit</dt>
    <dd>The client has requested that the record be processes as part of a
      ChannelGet::get or a ChannelPut::put.</dd>
  <dt>shareArrayBit</dt>
    <dd>The client has specified that array data be shared, e. g. has set
      record[shareData=true], In this case no copy of the array data is
      created. Instead data is transfered directly between network buffers and
      the data array in the V3 record. If this is specified the client must
      understand that if an array is split between network buffers the array
      may change between buffers.</dd>
  <dt>scalarValueBit</dt>
    <dd>The V3 field is a scalar.</dd>
  <dt>arrayValueBit</dt>
    <dd>The V3 field is an array.</dd>
  <dt>enumValueBit</dt>
    <dd>The V3 field is a DBF_ENUM, DBF_MENU, or DBF_DEVICE.</dd>
  <dt>timeStampBit</dt>
    <dd>The rrequester has requsted the timeStamp.</dd>
  <dt>alarmBit</dt>
    <dd>The requester has requested alarm info.</dd>
  <dt>displayBit</dt>
    <dd>The requseter has requested display info.</dd>
  <dt>controlBit</dt>
    <dd>The requester has requested control info.</dd>
  <dt>noAccessBit</dt>
    <dd>The V3 field is a no access field. The client will not be allows any
      access to the field.</dd>
  <dt>noModBit</dt>
    <dd>The V3 field is a no mod field. The client will not be allowed to
      modify the field.</dd>
  <dt>dbPutBit</dt>
    <dd>Side effects occur if a dbPut is issued to the field. ChannelPut will
      issue a dbPutField for such fields instead of directly modifying the
      field..</dd>
  <dt>isLinkBit</dt>
    <dd>Is the field a link field? Link fields require special handling for
      both get and put.</dd>
</dl>

<p>V3Util is defined as:</p>
<pre>class V3Util {
public:
    static int getProperties(Requester &amp;requester,PVStructure &amp;pvRequest,DbAddr &amp;dbAddr);
    static PVStructure *createPVStructure(Requester &amp;requester,int mask,DbAddr &amp;dbAddr);

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getProperties</dt>
    <dd>As mentioned that computes the mask discussed above.</dd>
  <dt>createPVStructure</dt>
    <dd>This method creates a PVStructure that holds data that is transfered
      between pvAccess and the V3 record. It uses a combination of the mask
      computed by gerProperties and the V3 DbAddr to determine the contents of
      the PVStructure.</dd>
  <dt>getPropertyData</dt>
    <dd>This gets display and control info from the V3 record. Note that this
      is called only once by V3ChannelGet or V3ChannelPut.</dd>
  <dt>get</dt>
    <dd>This gets data from the V3 record and puts it into the PVStructure.</dd>
  <dt>put</dt>
    <dd>This takes data from the PVStructure and puts it into the V3 record.
      Only the value field can be changed.</dd>
  <dt>putField</dt>
    <dd>This transfers data from the PVfield to the V3 field via a call to
      dbPutField.</dd>
  <dt>getScalarType</dt>
    <dd>This gets the scalar type associated for the V3 field being
    accessed.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="L446">V3Array</h4>

<p>This creates special implementations of PVByteArray, ... , PVStringArray
that access the corresponding array types in the V3 record. It provides the
ability to share data instead of making copies. It gets and puts array lengths
via the V3 record support entry table methods. Note that it has speciaized
methods for all of get, put, serialize, and deserialize that are not provided
by PVDataCreate,</p>

<p>V3Array is defined as:</p>
<pre>class V3ValueArrayCreate {
public:
    PVByteArray *createByteArray(PVStructure *parent,ScalarArrayConstPtr scalar,DbAddr &amp;dbAddr,bool shareData);
    PVShortArray *createShortArray(PVStructure *parent,ScalarArrayConstPtr scalar,DbAddr &amp;dbAddr,bool shareData);

    PVDoubleArray *createDoubleArray(PVStructure *parent,ScalarArrayConstPtr scalar,DbAddr &amp;dbAddr,bool shareData);
    // Note that V3StringArray can not share
    PVStringArray *createStringArray(PVStructure *parent,ScalarArrayConstPtr scalar,DbAddr &amp;dbAddr);
};

extern V3ValueArrayCreate *getV3ValueArrayCreate();</pre>

  <dt>createStringArray</dt>
    <dd>Create a PVFloatArray attached to a DBF_STRING array field. Note that
      it has special semantics to handle the fixed size strings that V3
      supports.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="L485">V3CAMonitor</h4>

<p>In V3 dbEvent is what implements db_post_event, which is what is called when
a field value changes in a V3 record. But dbEvent just passes this to V3CA.
Thus the only way to trap V3 monitors is via a call to ca_create_subscription.
The implementation takes only the following from the CAV3 event callback:
scalar value, alarm status and sererity, and the timeStamp. All other data,
e.g. array values, are taken from the record as a result of the CAV3 event
callback. </p>

<p>V3CAMonitor provides an enum that describes the data type of a V3 field as
seen by pvData.</p>
<pre>enum V3Type {
    v3Enum,
    v3Byte,
    v3Short,
    v3Int,
    v3Float,
    v3Double,
    v3String
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>v3Enum</dt>
    <dd>A pvData enumerated structure is created for this. The monitor request
      will be a DBR_TIME_ENUM.</dd>
  <dt>v3Byte</dt>
    <dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_CHAR.</dd>
  <dt>v3Short</dt>
    <dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_SHORT.</dd>
  <dt>v3Int</dt>
    <dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_LONG.</dd>
  <dt>v3Float</dt>
    <dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_FLOAT.</dd>
  <dt>v3Double</dt>
    <dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_DOUBLE.</dd>
  <dt>v3String</dt>
    <dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_STRING. Note that for strings
      data is taken from the record not from CAV3.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Next a C structure is defined in which data from CAV3 is put. Each time CAV3
calls the event callback the CAV3 data is copied to this structure.</p>
<pre>struct CAV3Data {
    CAV3Data();
    ~CAV3Data();
    /* The following have new values after each data event*/
    union { //only used for scalar values.
        int8   byteValue;
        int16  shortValue;
        int32  intValue;
        float  floatValue;
        double doubleValue;
    };
    epicsTimeStamp  timeStamp;
    int             sevr;
    int             stat;
    const char *    status;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>union</dt>
    <dd>This holds a scalar numeric value obtained from CAV3. If the field is
      an array or a DBF_STRING then the actual data is taken from the record
      via the DBADDR and RSET.</dd>
  <dt>timeStamp</dt>
    <dd>The epics timestamp obtained from CAV3.</dd>
  <dt>sevr</dt>
    <dd>The severity obtained from CAV3.</dd>
  <dt>stat</dt>
    <dd>The status obtained from CAV3.</dd>
  <dt>status</dt>
    <dd>The string value associated with stat. It is taken from
      epicsAlarmConditionStrings, which is an extrernal that is part of
      dbAccess.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Next is an interface that provides c++ callbacks that can be called by the C
callbacks that CAV3 calls:</p>
<pre>class CAV3MonitorRequester : public virtual epics::pvData::Requester {
public:
    virtual ~CAV3MonitorRequester(){}
    virtual void exceptionCallback(long status,long op) = 0;
    virtual void connectionCallback() = 0;
    virtual void accessRightsCallback() = 0;
    virtual void eventCallback(long status) = 0;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>exceptionCallback</dt>
    <dd>Called when CAV3 calls the exception callback.</dd>
  <dt>connectionCallback</dt>
    <dd>Called when CAV3 calls the connection callback.</dd>
  <dt>accessRightsCallback</dt>
    <dd>Called when CAV3 calls the access rights callback,</dd>
  <dt>eventCallback</dt>
    <dd>Called when CAV3 calls the event callback. The data in CAV3Data is
      updated before this is called,</dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally the interface for CAV3Monitor:</p>
<pre>class CAV3Monitor : private epics::pvData::NoDefaultMethods {
public:
    CAV3Monitor(CAV3MonitorRequester &amp;requester,String pvName,V3Type v3Type);
    ~CAV3Monitor();
    CAV3Data &amp; getData();
    void connect();
    void start();
    void stop();
    const char * getStatusString(long status);
    bool hasReadAccess();
    bool hasWriteAccess();
    bool isConnected();
private:
    class CAV3MonitorPvt *pImpl;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>connect</dt>
    <dd>Ask to connect. This calls ca_create_channel and
      ca_replace_access_rights_event.</dd>
  <dt>start</dt>
    <dd>This calls ca_create_subscription.</dd>
  <dt>stop</dt>
    <dd>This calls ca_clear_subscription.</dd>
  <dt>getStatusString</dt>
    <dd>This returns ca_message(status),</dd>
  <dt>hasReadAccess</dt>
    <dd>This calls ca_read_access. This will always be true because CAV3 treats
      this a local rather than remote client.</dd>
  <dt>hasWriteAccess</dt>
    <dd>This calls ca_write_access. This will always be true because CAV3
      treats this a local rather than remote client.</dd>
  <dt>isConnected</dt>
    <dd>This calls ca_state to determine connection state. If connected this
      should always return true.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="L645">V3CAContext</h4>

<p>CAV3Monitor calls CAV3 in order to monitor changes to the V3 records. In
order to do this it must call ca_context_create(ca_enable_preemptive_callback).
It must call this from the thread that wil make calls to CAV3. But it must also
call ca_attach_context from any other threads associated with the thread that
calls ca_context_create. The putpose of V3CAContext is to manage this
interaction with CAV3.</p>

<p>For each thread that V3Channel uses and that makes a CreateMonitor
V3CAContext keeps a reference count. This is decremented when
CAV3Contect::release is called, which is done when a V3CAMonitor is deleted.
Only when the thread that originally resulted in a V3CAContext exits is the
V3CAContext deleted.</p>

<p>V4CAContext is defined as:</p>
<pre>class CAV3Context {
public:
    ~CAV3Context
    void release();
    void stop();
    void exception(String message);
    void checkContext();
private:
 ...
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>~CAV3Context</dt>
    <dd>This does nothing.</dd>
  <dt>release</dt>
    <dd>This is called by CAV3Monitor when a monitor is being destroyed.</dd>
  <dt>stop</dt>
    <dd>This is called when the thread that created the CAV3Context exits. That
      is when ca_context_destroy is called.</dd>
  <dt>exception</dt>
    <dd>This is called when CAV3 calls the exception callback that V3CAContext
      registers.</dd>
  <dt>checkContext</dt>
    <dd>This is called before any call to CAV3. It checks to see if the calling
      thread is aleady known to CAV3. If not ca_attach_contex is called.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There is a separate class for creating a context:</p>
<pre>class CAV3ContextCreate {
public:
    static CAV3Context &amp;get(Requester &amp;requester);
private:
 ...
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>get</dt>
    <dd>This checks to see if the thread has already known to CAV3, i. e. if a
      CAV3Context altready exists for the calling thread. If so it is returned.
      If not a new CAV3Context is created and returned.</dd>
</dl>
